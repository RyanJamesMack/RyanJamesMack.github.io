# 1. README
## 2. Purpose
This README provides a reference of how to host markdown files as a static site. This is accomplished by referencing concepts from Andrew Etters book *Modern Technical Writing.*
## 3. Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the Markdown language
- A resume in the form of a Markdown file (.md) that can be hosted. 
## 4. Instructions
1. Log in to your Github account. If you have not created one, you can follow this guide to create one: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github. Github is one option for a version control software the Etter recommends in his book *Modern Technical Writing.* 
2. Create a public repository with a naming syntax of *account_name*.github.io. This format is necessary to be able to host your resume on Github pages. Once complete you should be able to see the new repository in the list of your current repositories.
3. Upload your Markdown resume to your Github repository. This can be done by clicking the add file button once you are inside your repository. The file should be in the markdown language so that it is easy modify if changes ever need to be made.
4. Change the name of your resume to **index.md**. This is also necessary for Github to host your site as Github will not recognize it otherwise.
5. Create a new file name _config.yml. This file will be responsible for converting your Markdown resume into a website that Github can use. From this _config.yml file you are able to configure all the necessary Jekyll settings to generate your website.
6. Now that all the necessary files have been created you can host your website! Open a new tab and type *account_name*.github.io. The static website that you just hosted should appear! Congratulations, you just hosted your first website.
