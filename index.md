Vision Statement
---------
UStep is an academic application designed to help students track their current course grades, predict their final grades based on input, and view and add course reviews for courses offered by their department.

Intended Users
---------
The UStep app will serve as an educational and user-friendly tool designed to streamline academic performance for students at the University of Manitoba. This app will assist users in planning their course journey by providing an interactive experience that manages their progress toward achieving good grade in a course. Students will be able to register/sign in with their email, and password, further specifying their major degree and year of study. Based on this information, the app will create a course catalogue, which will automatically fetch the courses offered by the specified major department. Moreover, students will be able to add or remove from the list their past and current courses.
